Hello there! I am Bruno from Argentina, Computer Engineering student.

Solving, programming and learning stuff is what i enjoy the most, so you could always find me knocking my head trying to solve some problem.

Python is the language that identifies me the most, i find it really easy and pretty to read Python code (as it should be!) despite that i am a pythonista wannabe :p

Learning is what drives me every day, and i think more than a pinch of humility is needed in order to achieve this goal. If you are like me who have no problem at all saying "i don't know" then we will get along, i will learn a lot from you, and maybe you can learn something from me :)
