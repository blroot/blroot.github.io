[Read moreâ€¦]

I've been doing a lot of research about developing with Docker lately and i think is a great tool for us (developers) so, expect an introduction (tutorial, slides, whatever..) about that soon. I've been working on some testing and TDD (test driven development) lately and i feel like i could give some sort of intro on that too.

I also have a to-do list for the rest of this beautiful year

Here we go:

    Learn about Tornado
    Write a RESTful API
    Do TDD on a real project

That's all for now, see you soon!
